# -MLOps_Fundamentals
Ml + Ops steps
1) data ingestions--> Datapipeline
2) EDA 
3) Feature Engineering
4) building model
5) evaluation
6) Deploy thre model
7) Monitoring
8) Retraining

what is devops?
development + Operations
dev -> code + testing
ops-> deploy = operations

### MLOPS vs DEVops
ML + DEV + OPS
Mlops is not the traditional development

file stuctute explanations
experiments -> all ipynb files
src --> all features
src/components --> all project components 


1) training pipeline-->  data-> data_validations+ features_engineering + model_training+ model_evaluation
